title: haste is bad, think twice before pressing any button

haste is bad for programmers, you hastily click a button and later
find that it was a mistake, you click on some other button to fix that
and you just pinged/notified/disturbed others (twice) cc'd on that
page.

you might delete some important data or you might configure some wrong
setting on the server which might potentially affect thousands of
users. you merge an untested patch at the last minute which might
break the release.

so think twice before performing any action. speak out what you are
about to do and ask your rubber duck "is it the right thing to do".
