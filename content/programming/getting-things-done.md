title: getting things done
date: 2025-09-18

it takes time. put in time and you get things done. put in little
little time in multiple places and you hardly make any progress in
any of them. if you hit a wall, ask yourself what's the problem and 
how it can be fixed. always maintain a log of what you thought and did
and what you found. initially it takes some time before things start
making any sense.

ask for help from your mentors or from devs on irc as soon as you find
you are not making any progress even after trying a few approaches. a
fragmented effort doesn't produce much results, so make sure you are
not shifting contexts often.
