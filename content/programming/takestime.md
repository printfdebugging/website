title: it takes time, don't ^C immediately

today i installed windows 10 in a vm and for some time the progress
bar on the installer was stuck to 0%, i thought something is wrong and
was about to press cross button but then at the last moment decided
against it, thought i should wait for a few more moments.

all the sudden the progress counter changed to 100% and i learnt this
lesson. had i pressed that button, i would have wasted quite some time
as i am sure the next time it would have taken the same time, but the
frustration would have built up. but "sometimes things take time" this
shouldn't be used as an excuse for merging crappy code into master :).
so be patient but not blind, blind to obvious problems.
