title: you own the code you write, thus are responsible for it

this applies to a `junior++ && senior--` developer. during a project
there are a lot of moments which pivit the direction of development,
be it changes in the proposed interface layout, or some additional
feature/mechanism which aren't that simple.

taking input/suggestions is nice but at the end you must decide for
yourself whether you want to follow those suggestions or not. because
at the end, you have to implement it and maintain it. having realistic
proposals and verifying their validity before starting the work is a
nice way to avoid such issues later down othe road. that said, things can
be incrementally added, one at a time.
