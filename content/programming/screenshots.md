title: add nice screenshots to the patches

when pushing ui changes, it's very very important that we add the
screenshots along with the change. that way it becomes very easy
for the reviewers as they know what to look for while testing,
often issues are directly visible in the screenshots, so the
review-rework-push cycle moves quickly.
