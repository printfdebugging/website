title: read others code and review their patches

i have noticed that senior/experienced developers don't shy away from
poking into other's patches. this is a great habbit to inculcate as
you keep yourself updated with the changes happening in the codebase.
you would pick up good habbits as you read others patches. this down
the road would save you a lot of time in reviews.

you then know who worked on what yesterday and whom to talk to about
certain areas of the codebase. reading patches and asking quesions
also helps improve the code quality and it is a nice social thing in
itself.
