programming is a creative domain and there are many ways to approach
a problem. experimentation is therefore important to understand
different aspects of a concept, problem or even the solution.
tutorials and books are usually linear, good ones suggest you some
experiments to do on your own.

a good programmer should have the patience to stay with one concept,
problem or solution for a little longer and play with it, tweek the
parameters and see what happens. the insights you gain from that are
quite valuable.
