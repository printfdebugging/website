title: the art of writing commit messages

the commit message should be clean and to the point. it should not
include any text walls which might make it hard for the reader to
distinguish useful information from some text that you thought would
be nice there.

write everything that (you or) your fellow developer from future
should know about the code you are pushing, when they git blame and
read the commit message, they should get the whole technical and
design story of that change.
