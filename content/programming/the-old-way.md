some problems are complex and comments and class hierarchy on a text
file might not be enough to understand the problem. a text file allows
you to write only in two directions, up or down.

paper on the other hand provides you four dimentions and more
expressibility. you can draw boxes, arrows from one thing to the other
and illustrations. some problems require a more expressive medium than
just thought and a text file, and nothing beats the good old
paper-pencil combo at that.
