title: the importance of mentors

early in a career in any field be it sports or programming, one needs
good mentors. mentors help you with the basics, support and correct
you when you make mistakes and keep a watch over you to not let you go
stray.

one bad programming habbit i have is that i start running ahead of
myself, i would create an empty project and start with a logger
implementation and then would ask others how do we save user events to
the disk to be able to replay them. and i haven't rendered a single
triangle on the screen.

thanks to [nitrix] calling me a moron on #c, i realized this. i should
focus on making progress in the project and these abstractions like
logger, or classes/structs to bundle things together should come
naturally as an after effect, i shouldn't start with them.

as someone learning, one should learn without any fear of judgement
or disapproval. good developers often don't sugar coat things and
sometimes it can be pointy. you are there to learn and learn from the
scoldings too, "why are you being scolded", what did you do wrong?

sometimes in arguments over approaches, there is this urge to prove
your point and put the other's argument down, don't give into it.
always put both sides side-by-side and without bias see which one is
better, if you find other's argument week, point it out politely.

            good mentors are gems and if you have one, find yourself lucky
            and if you get a chance to mentor someone, find yourself lucky
                            "you learn more when you teach"
```
