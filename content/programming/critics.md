critiques are good, they help you improve, but not all critiques are
good, and for those bad ones, one needs to stand for their opinions.
these critiques don't provide any solid reasoning in their comments,
just say "i don't like it", "i don't agree", "i am against it", or
they use too many words which conveny almost nothing.

good ones tell you "why they dislike the idea" and what they consider
a better approach/solution.
