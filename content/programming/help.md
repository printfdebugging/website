title: searching for help on a disfunctional internet

:) internet is quite functional if you know what you want, it's not
a safe place for the clueless wonderers, it has never been. after
gathering some basic vocubulary from the internet you should ask about
it on appropriate irc and matrix channels. after that you would have
a pretty good idea about the topic. i got a gamedev/opengl mentor on irc.

books by far are the best place to gain deep knowledge about any topic
if you are just starting out. it can either be a traditional book or a
website like [learncpp.com] and [learnopengl.com]. if you want to know
about the practical usage of that knowledge, you should dive into open
source projects.
