title: writing code top down

the high level understanding of the problem/code comes first. once you
have that, implementation becomes quite easy. then you go to the lower
level details like the language constructs and the apis needed for the
implementation.

while writing code we start with high level functions and break them
into smaller helper functions doing the low level stuff. we don't mix
high level functions with low level operations. this doesn't mean you
start out with some design or write a lot of boiler plate code. read
[delay design decisions] and [refactoring code]
to know more about design and refactoring.
