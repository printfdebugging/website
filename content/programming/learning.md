150-200 page books are a good place to start. man pages are ok for
cli tools but for bigger tools and languages, one needs a good book.
after gaining some experience, one might want to dive deep into the
specification to learn more about the system.

and it takes time. programming skills don't compound if you keep
switching context on a weekly/monthly basis. you have to do one
thing for years to get good at it. and it takes long sittings at a
time. constant context switching isn't helpful, you gain some insights
only when you spend some time with the problem.
