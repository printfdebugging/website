reading is the single most important skill one requires as a
programmer. we don't just read the code, but the comments, the
reviews, the instructions and user feedback. reading is therefore a
skill we cannot ignore or assume as something which comes naturally.

one must pay attention to each word with their whole attention reading
at a slow steady pace. i miss out on important details when i try to
read fast or skim over the text. :) that one time i asked for help
and i learnt that it was already mentioned by szymon in one of his
comments.

reading requires patience, therefore it's not like one can be good at
reading and live a chaotic life, the whole lifestyle, things you do
in a day have to complement the conditions required for one to be and
remain a good reader.
