title: read the friendly manual

the friendly manual has all the answers. it can be quite long
sometimes and it may require some tries before you find what you were
looking for. patience and reading skills are the key here. i often
make a mistake where i quickly scroll my eyes over the manual trying
to spot the answer, and most of the times, i miss the spot and thus
end up spending more time to find my solution.

a good manual has topic wise examples, make sure you include them if
you happen to write one. but most manuals don't have examples, so
don't expect to find the solution straight away, it might require some
experimentation. you can ask on IRC channels and get pointers to the
topics which you should read from the manual to find what you are
looking for.

don't use AI, it enforces bad habbits and expectations and you don't
build muscle over time as LLMs are black boxes. reading man pages
on the other hand is like using vim, it would be slow at first but
you build intuition and muscle memory over time and it keeps getting
better from there.
