often error messages are quite long and it's a hunt to find the
useful ones. redirecting the log/errors to a log file is one possible
solution. even then it takes patience and quite some scrolling before
you get to the important part. the editor can highlight keywords like
`ERROR` or `FAILURE` to help spot the hotspots.
