title: reading other's code

often a task involves jumping into a new area in the codebase and
figuring out how the code there works, what causes the buggy behaviour
and how to fix it. here are the levels at which this is done:

- get pointers from someone who knows that area well
- read the code and build a mental model
- git log and see the commit-messages and diffs which added/modified the code
- ask for help :)
