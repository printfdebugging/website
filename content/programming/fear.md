title: the initial few hours into a project are a bit scary

maybe i am the coward one, whenever i start a new project, i am scared
out of my wits, i quite literally feel a vacuum around me. at that
point the instincts take over and either i fight or flight :). i
recently learnt that it's all about understanding.

as you start a new project, you know almost nothing about it. as you
read more and more code, when you ask questions and find answers to
them, when you take some help (after a few decent tries), you slowly
start understanding and pick up the speed, the fear goes away.

the initial few hours were scary for me because i was rushing towards
the solution, through shortcuts in a town i knew nothing about, no
surprise they led me to some pretty scary places. approach a project
from the perspective of understanding the problem, the code around it.
