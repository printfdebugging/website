speak slowly, that's the mantra. focus on delivering what you think.
it will make through without any issues. trying too hard is the first
step to failure. small pauses while thinking are fine, everyone has to
do a word lookup, even the natives.

don't fake the accent. i know some people who do that, and even i
can't understand what they are saying. good people generally don't
care about your accent as long as they hear you. there's a vocabulary
associated with the professions, make sure to learn it. "shooting
in the foot" is a well known one in the c/c++ community.
