title: don't stop at just one change

senior developers don't stop at just one patch in the area. they send
patches from one area in dozens, each building over the previous, or
maybe not. this might be because they notice problems as they go over
the code and then as a consequence end up writing a lot of patches to
fix those.

simply put, be interested in the code around the change, don't just be
focused on fixing the issue at hand and you would build insights over
time. an easy way is to zoom out at the mental model of the code you
just worked on, and push the boundaries of that model just a little
beyond the known region.
