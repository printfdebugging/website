in disciplines like programming where you don't have a clearly laid
out plan, it's quite easy to pick up 10 things on the way and jump
from one to the other every other day and waste a lot of time doing
this.

one must ask themselves what they are after, what they want to achieve
by doing one thing or the other and then focus on one thing at a time,
on the thing which makes the most sense at the moment.
