title: push -> review -> rework -> review cycle, the programming pipeline

for a long time i believed my work is done as soon as i have a working
patch and i push it, it's on the reviewers then to check it and either
push it or ask for changes. pushing the changes is only half the work.

the rest of it involves checking which patches are pending, pinging
the reviewers after a reasonable amount of time, making sure the
patches are rebased and fixing issues pointed out in the reviews.
if one isn't paying attention, these can quickly pile up and then
it would be hard for both the reviewer and the uploader to navigate
through that pile.
