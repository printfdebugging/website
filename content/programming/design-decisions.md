delay design decisions for as long as possible, only work on things
which you think are absolutely neccessary to make progrss. long
functions, long files are not bad specially when you are starting out.

this is good because the future you would have more context on the
problem and would be able to make wiser choices, also then the
consequences of wrong decisions would be low as you would have made
quite some progress by not building blocks and falling over them over
and over.
