if you have questions while working, note them down in the logs, ask
later. some questions can distract you from the important issue at
hand. often staying with your questions gives you answers to them.
don't ask questions ahead of time, they are just distractions.

for valid questions, first look for the answers yourself. if you don't
find anything after a few attempts, ask your mentors or developers on
irc. ask one question at a time. if you have some new questions about the
answers you are getting, note them down, first let the current context
conclude.
