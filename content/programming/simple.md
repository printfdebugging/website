title: complexity and clever solutions come back to bite you

clever solutions are often complex and therefore only a few understand
them. thus other devs might change the code around your complex
solution and the whole thing might fall apart. thus it becomes a
maintainance nightmare.

good reviewers usually don't approve such changes, or if they don't
oppose it, their reluctance to push it is quite clear. code is not an
asset, it's a liability, and i don't remember the exact implementation
details of projects i implemented an year ago. so keep it simple and
you would thank yourself.
