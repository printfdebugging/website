understanding is the key. if you understand the problem space and
the problem surface, then it becomes as simple as wanting something
and knowing exactly what will do what and what one has to do to
get something to work. this works on all kinds of problems on all
scales, though larger problems require more time (patience) and well
documented logs to stay focused.

asking good/decisive questions helps understand the problem
space/surface faster. questions like:

- what exactly happens when i do this
- how does that happen
- what does this code do
- how does the stack look like at that point
- how does the value of this variable change over some interaction

these questions give a direction to the investigation, threads which
you can hold on to, one at a time. and as you go over a few of them,
they start coming together and you reach a point where you have
covered quite a lot of the problem surface.

with hard/complicated problems, shortcuts are almost always bad. while
estemating, almost always estemate time needed to cover the surface
area of the problem and a few days for the fixing the problem which
includes cleanup, tests and reviews -- you would have a working
prototype as you cover the surface.
