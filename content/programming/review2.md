title: when to ask others to review your patches
date: 2025-10-28

reviewers are developers often busier than you :) so if you cc them
as soon as you push the patch, "they can't do anything" since the ci
hasn't finished. what if the ci fails? they will get a notification
too and they can't do anything, and you just wasted their time.

so, ask others for a review (cc them or message them) only once the ci
passes and you want a final thumbs up from them. asking for help is
different from asking to review, if you are stuck and have exhaused
quite a few approaches, you should ask for help. see [reading others'
code](/programming/code-reading/)
