title: the process matters if it gets results (mostly)

processes are important, no doubts about that. processes by themselves
mean nothing, they can't exist in vacuum. and if a process exists for
something, some goal, some result, what's the point if it doesn't help
you progress towards that goal/result.

so results matter at the end, and based on results and goals you
create processes which help you achieve them. in other words: get
stuff done.

processes are medium difficulty to design and hard to implement. so,
you only do it for things that repeat often or are system critical.
everything else better to keep organic.
