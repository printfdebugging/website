title: i love unit tests and code reviews

unit tests don't just save me from extra work on regressions
introduced by someone else's changes somewhere, they also help the
other developers find bugs in their code. now when unit tests fail on
my code, i am thankful that someone wrote that test or else the bug
might have slipped into the code unnoticed. 

not to undermine the role reviewers have in making sure that the
code isn't sloppy or missing some edge case somewhere. i learn
from reviewers (senior devs) the way to think about edge cases and
potential bugs, how to find them and squash them.
