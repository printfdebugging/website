man pages and documentation are the original sources of knowledge on
any tool or language. good documentation involves tutorials to get one
used to the tool. then there are some good books on the topic.

manpages, documentation and books can be outdated though. so it's
important to read them with a grain of salt and if something doesn't
match then looking at the code is the next best step. looking at 
code (eg: oss projects) comes in quite handy when learning some new
language or library as it takes you beyond the tutorial.
