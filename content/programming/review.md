title: be the first reviewer before pushing the changes

before pushing the patch, review it yourself both the small change
that you just made and where it stands in the long series of changes
or in relation to the change you are going to ammend it to. often
it happens that an ammend voids the previously added comments and
assumptions in code, so they need to be updated. then question every
single line as if it's not your code and then push and ask someone
else to review it.

you are responsible for the changes you push therefore you should do
the most amount of work to see that it's correct. pushing changes
carelessly, expecting someone else to correct you shows how involved
you are in the process.
