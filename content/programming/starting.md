title: starting the day with a list of tasks
date: 2025-10-11

same as you don't take on the ocean without a map of the seas, you
don't start your day as a programmer without a clear plan. the plan is
basically a text file with the list of tasks you would be working on
during the day and the timeboxes for those tasks.

so while working on those tasks, you would have a clear idea of the
progress you made that day and you would be able to adjust your pace
accordingly. while investigating or programming, one roams around the
codebase a lot and often gets lost. having such a list quickly reminds
you of the priorities. read [a timer is better than a clock for timeboxing]
