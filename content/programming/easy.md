title: no task is easier than other

i think i wrote about this before, but will do again. no task is
easier than other, some take less time, some take more. i made a
similar statement recently "this is easy, just a 10m task" regarding a
task, and it took me quite some time to finish it. similar thing
happened with another taks in the past, i thought it's easy and i
overlooked some details, which were caught in a code review.
