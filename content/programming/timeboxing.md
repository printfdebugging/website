title: a timer is better than a clock for timeboxing

timeboxing means allocating certain amount of time to work on some
specific task. while working it's easy to get sidetracked from the
original task, so it's important to keep asking yourself, "what am
i working on now", "what am i trying to achieve by working on it" 
"what's my approach" and "by working on it, am i making progress on
the task".

don't use a wall-clock for time tracking, it's a distraction, instead
use a timer application like [alarm-clock-applet] which tells you "how
much time is left" in this timebox. when i use a timer, i feel as
though time doesn't exist and it's just me in a box. clock on the other
hand introduces an overhead about what time it is now and all the
implications that awareness brings about.
