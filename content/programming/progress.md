title: making progress on tasks

it's quite easy to drift off in certain unwanted direction like
reading a comment in the codebase about a tool and then reading the
whole manpage of that tool, or joining the irc channel for that tool
to discuss certian term you couldn't understand from the man page. but
it wasn't about the tool in the first place.

this is called 'getting distracted or sidetracked', and it's a big
hurdle preventing you from finishing the tasks. one has to narrow down
their focus to things which help make progress on the task. having an
agenda before starting the work helps, and there after you can just
check whether what you are doing aligns with the agenda or not.

the agenda should be specific, it's your plate for the day. put no
more than what you can eat and digest. be consistent, and that's how
you eat an elephant, one bite at a time.
