title: don't rush to get the changes in

when something is almost done, it's tempting to quickly get it
reviewed and merged. while you shouldn't stall things unnecessarily,
it's equaly important that you don't create a rush to get the changes
in.

if you are not sure about something, take some more time, understand
what works and why, potential bugs, add tests and then start the
review process. if the action statement involves the terms like `last
minute` or `just before` or `quickly`, then be extra careful and get
some more time if possible.
