i recently learnt a very important lesson, the most important skill
one needs as a programmer is to "figure out the unknown". for most
great things, there aren't any predefined steps, people try different
things, fail at many. these failures/experiments help in knowledge
building and after a point they have sufficient knowledge to make it
work.

i learnt that there are no shortcuts that one must take the same long
path that many took before them. it might be that the others who went
that way left some nice sign boards & journals about their journey,
but it might as well be the case that you are the first one exploring
that road.

i was scared of failing, i would double check things on the internet
before writing them in the code, i learnt to be comfortable around
errors. it's fine if you can't get it to work in the first go, just
run it and figure out what's not working.
