proper planning is the most important part of any project, you keep
track of the most important resource i.e. time. weekly milestones help
with this, you know where you want to be at the end of this week and
therefore you know how to spend the time you have. this way you are
not shooting arrows in the dark and have a roadmap.

planning is not easy, you can over estimate your abilities and
add too much to your plate. so having a reasonable free buffer is
also important so that you have some time to be creative with your
approach, some wiggle room for possibilities.
