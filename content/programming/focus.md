reading, focus, attention are quite important skills for a software
engineer to be good at. how good you are at these skills depends on
the environment more than you, choices are yours to make though.

i am back to using a single monitor instead of two because i find it
easy to focus when i have a single monitor. reading a book before
sleeping is another thing i am doing now.
