we can also reword this topic as "asking for help the right way". we
are trying something, it's not working and we need help. we go to an
irc or matrix chat and share what we were trying to do. now at this
point we should make sure that we provide the complete context and
complete description of the problem and the findings from various
attempts at it.

we should also avoid half baked sentenses because they can mislead
the readers about the problem wasting their time. sharing some
screenshots, pastebins and steps to reproduce are much appreciated.
