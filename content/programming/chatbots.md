chatbots are not tools, most of the times they are black boxes
controled by big companies. they aren't reliable and to write
something usable, it takes more time to fix the code written by a
chatbot than writing it yourself from scratch.

the worst part is that you don't have any control over their pricing,
the quality of results they produce and the algorithm working behind
the scenes.
