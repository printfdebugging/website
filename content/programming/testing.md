title: testing one last time

it's important to test things one last time before pushing the changes
for review. often some change would break something else around it
which worked just fine before the change. if you work based on
assumptions then you would assume "something works as it did", but in
reality it does not anymore. it's a good practice to validate your
assumptions atleast once when starting the work, and once before
pushing the change.
