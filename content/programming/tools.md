title: better tools exist, the cli ones

cli tools are better than gui tools (generally) as they are way more
extensible and they don't change much over time. cli tools can be
cobbled together to accomplish some complex task. open source tools
are better than propriatery tools.

since they don't change over time, you are less likely to face any
hinderance in your workflows. cli tools often provide qutie powerful
mechanisms (like vim macros) and complex tasks become quite simple
when you utilize these mechanisms.
