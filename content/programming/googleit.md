some error messages like file not found can be fixed by some
investigation, other's which are more complex can be googled. it's
quite possible that someone else got that error and asked about
it either in some github issue or some developer forum like stack
overflow.

asking on irc/matrix can be helpful, you get help pretty quickly on
irc/matrix specially for errors related to languages and tools. you
can also get some good ideas as people there are quite experienced
with software and tools.
