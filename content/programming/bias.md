title: bias and assumptions

confirm the code does what you think it does. i just copied some code
and refactored it into a function assuming that it takes me to a
particular cell. but actually it was code to assert that this cell is
a particular cell. that's why it's important to read code carefully.

another such assumption can be thinking that you read all the code
in ana file d you know what it does. it happened to me once, i had
read some code a few weeks ago so i didn't bother reading it again
and assumed that i have an idea of what it does. turns out i didn't
quite understand the code i read the last time and i there were some
callbacks i wasn't aware of, which were needed to fix the problem i
was working on. 

there's no harm in quickly going over what you know once again, maybe
write it in a structured order, start with some questions and read
the code while finding answers to them. ask yourself, `do i really
understand the code i am working with` as that's the most important
question.
