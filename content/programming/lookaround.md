title: look around the code you are editing

sometimes you are blinded by your understanding of the problem, your
mental model. therefore one must ask others for code review to see if
what you think is indeed the best solution or if there's something
obviously wrong with it which you aren't able to see.

sometimes the answer is in the code around the lines you are working
so make sure that you look around, read a few function declarations
above and below and see how things are done there, if it has anything
which you can reuse, some better way of doing things. sometimes it's
not "obvious" so read diligently.
