i have tried to make regular physical exercise as a part of my daily
schedule, but didn't have any success that way as i always postponed
it. [pedro] (my manager at collabora) advised me to do it as the first
thing in the morning. i tried it and it works. i am super focused in
the mornings because there isn't anything on my head and what better
way to start the day than some physical exercise. once it's done, it
gets out of my way, i don't have to schedule or plan for it anymore.
