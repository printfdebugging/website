I am Sahil Gautam, from India. I live  in the state Haryana, which is in the north
of  New  Delhi.  During  the  second  year of  my  college  I  got  involved  with
[LibreOffice development], and one  year later worked on a GSoC  project. Now I am
working for an open source  company [allotropia], mostly hacking LibreOffice. Here
are links to my [Github] and [Mail].



All the blogs are well organized  into various sections (listed below) each having
it's own feed linked  next to the section heading. The feed  for the whole website
is linked next to the home page's title. **Enjoy the reads...**
