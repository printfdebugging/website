title: don't fall prey to false ideas/observations

our brains are wired to pay more attention to the negative side,
to the shortcomings, to differences and it amplifies them. that's
why some outrageous fake news spreads so fast, that's why we need
moderators in forums and public rooms.

this becomes much more important in 1:1 conversations or even in group
conversations specially at new places where we are constantly judging
others and forming an opinion of them. take some time and let things
settle, the "bad" guys aren't that bad and the "good" guys aren't that
good, they are just people, just like you.
