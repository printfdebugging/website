developers can be straight forward at times, a bit unfiltered. being
aware of this and taking arguments and criticism constructively can
help you understand what's being said. with every comment the
conversation takes a turn from one point to another, make sure your
comments push it towards the positive direction.

not taking everything personally helps with this. trying to understand
the argument from their perspective also helps deal with such issues
or atleast not escalate it further. the goal is to come to a mutual
understanding and for that it's important that you start out assuming
that things are said in good faith.
