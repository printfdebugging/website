title: the attitude to approach conversations

one's approach to conversations and discussions matters, whether one
is there to assert dominance and gain validation or one is there to
learn, to find out and help. one must remember it's not about them
it's about the project or the bigger picture and they are just the
means and not the end.

so whenever you are talking in front of the camera of an audience,
just be yourself and focus on why you are there and do justice to that
cause. don't be rigid and scared of judgement, good people care about
the important things, a seasoned runner won't judge you, and what the
bystanders think doesn't matter. don't look at yourself through
someone else's eyes, it doesn't help. thus you don't have to force a
smile or conform to a certain accent.
