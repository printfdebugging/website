often pauses in conversations are associated with awkwardnewss where
both parties are wondering what to talk about next. turns out pauses
are not that awkward. conversations are living phenomenon and they
have some quite moments, some heated ones and some balanced ones. 

think of the pauses as an opportunity to absorb the last conversation
and gain deeper insights about the topic, and about yourself. no one likes
if you keep dragging a conversation without letting them have some
space, some breathing room.
