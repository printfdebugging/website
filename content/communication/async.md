title: asynchronous conversations as a remote developer
date: 2025-11-27

when working with a remote team, it is usually the case that people
are working in different timezones so not everyone would be online
when you are. being online doesn't mean that they are looking at
the chat application, they might have put the notifications on
do-not-disturb and might be in the middle of work. so you might
not get an instant reply.

therefore the way to approach these conversations is to not ping
someone unless important, as they might be disturbed by the
notification. if it's urgent, then say so with the message, or else
just drop the message, wait for a minute and go off and do your thing
because you don't know when they are going to read it and reply.
