[no question is a dumb question, just ask]. but if you don't have any
questions, you were probably not listening. a programmer must be as
good a listener as a speaker. you should listen and see beyond the
words, often one word packs a lot of assumptions and context which
needs clarification.

[no question is a dumb question, just ask]: /communication/dumb-questions/

avoid multitasking while in meetings and while talking to people.
this helps understand the topic at hand better. pay attention to each
word, build mental model of what's being said. reading good books and
participating in deep conversations and then backtracking and avoiding
fast paced content helps improve the listening.
