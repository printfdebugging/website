each conversation has a context which sets some boundaries and some
assumptions, and a group of people who are aware about it. some
conversations are in private context, some are in public context.
information related to a project's progress should remain in the
public context.

private context involves company secrets or 1:1 conversations, they
shouldn't be made public without the concent of concerned parties. in
a conversation, changing context or saying something out of contexting
is considered rude, sure you can change the context and the direction
of conversation at transition points, but not in the middle, specially
in meetings with a well defined agenda.
