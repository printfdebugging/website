title: the formal setting of programming conversations

programmers are quite unfiltered people from different cultures,
with different personalities. so their selection of words to express
extreme expressions also vary. some tend to be nice and polite, while
other's are more expressive and frank.

it's quite tempting to join the frank conversations and it's fine if
you do but remember you are in a professional setting. some frank
words from a senior developer's mouth might be perceived totally
differently v/s the same words were uttered by a new joinee. it's
about being aware of the line even in frank situations and actively
maintaining a healthy distance from it.
