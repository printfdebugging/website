everyone is entitled to have opinions, but do they mean anything and
where are they worth sharing. these are some questions one must ask
themselves atleast once before sharing any opinions. for example
political opinions aren't well placed in a developer chat.

opinions on abstract things don't mean much. one should not have opinions
about things which they know nothing about. it also matters how an opinion
is presented, wording matters, timing matters and the context of the
conversation matters.
