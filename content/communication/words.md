title: how you say it matters in ways you might not be aware of

right when you think that you have a language figured out, you realize
there's a human side to the language and it's interpretation which
means how the others read/hear it matters. therefore communication
is not just about language, but about how to use it's constructs to
say what you want to say and make sure that the other hears what you
wanted to say.

what you say might be perceived in ways that you can't even imagine
because you lack some information that the readers/listeners have, but
they might not know that you don't know what they know. thus the act of
speaking or writing becomes one of much more responsibility where
you might want to consult experts about how you should put something
into words. the experts can be people, good books, recordings of
events, or anything which makes your writing/speech a living thing,
one which doesn't need explainations afterwards.
