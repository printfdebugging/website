title: text conversations as a programmer
date: 2025-09-25

happens on irc and internal channels. a context is set with the first
message and it picks up direction as messages pile up. unlike in
person conversations where you can cross question and interrupt the
other person, these text based conversations have very less scope of
diversion from the direction they have taken on.

i offended some people on irc doing that unknowingly, so please don't
do that. let that conversation reach a conclusion then ask your
questions which were not directly related but around the same topic
and ask one question at a time.
