"clever people" never say the thing that they want to say directly but
rather start with a buildup around it which mostly is to present the
thing from their perspectives and convince the listeners what they are
saying is the truth. same goes for flattery, it's hardly of any use
but it can cause great destruction if one falls for it.

simple things are said in few words without any sugar coating around.
this makes things simple, without any hidden strings attached. good
people say their piece and the terms.
