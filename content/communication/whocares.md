title: conversations while looking at the self through other's eyes

i find the who-cares attitude quite useful. it's about not caring what
the other would think of you when you do or say or write something.
it's about not being attached to the self so much that you seek praise
or avoid criticism. 

this doesn't mean write anything, of-course you must think about what
you are writing but you must think without associating the sense self
to it. you say what needs to be said and choose the words [carefully].

when you disassociate the self, you simply don't care if anyone
reacted with emojis on your comment or what would others think, or
who has seen what you wrote and who thinks what about it. this is
specially noticable when you are interacting live with an audience
or while giving a talk, you would be able to focus on the talk (the
important thing at hand) and the self simply won't bother you, or
praises won't bloat it, or criticism won't shatter it.

once you stop caring about the self, you would find that you are no
longer looking for more emojis or sending more emojis. you would face
this moment as is and not through a reflection in a self obsessed
mirror which shows what it's owner wants to see. therefore you would
notice that you are on the same page as others who don't live in
reflections.

[carefully]: /communication/words
