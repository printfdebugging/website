title: verbal and non-verbal feedback in conversations

part of being a good listener is giving live feedbacks about the
conversation, just listening quitely is not enough. this can be done
by reflecting what you hear on your past experiences and finding out
where that relates. then you can share what you understood by that
thruogh the examples from the past. if you got it right, you would get
a thumbs up, or else you would be corrected. the emphasis is on
"speaking back" and not just listening and saying "yes" in the end.

your past experiences doesn't necessarily mean experiences but knowledge
of things related to the topic in general. while certain feedback is
important, some should be avoided. reacting to something without
understanding it is a bad feedback, this applies not just to
conversations but everything else.
