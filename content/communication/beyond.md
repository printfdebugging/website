title: see beyond flattery and gestures, the content

the content of a conversation matters the most and the way it has been
said matters the least, though it matters somewhat. each word holds
some context and some assumptions. if you don't focus on the content,
you would find yourself in a made up context.

flattery is bad in general as it makes you dependent on others for
validation and when that happens, someone else gets the power to
decide how you feel or whether you feel validated or not. similarly
criticism is good for opposite reasons.
