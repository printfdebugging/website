don't rush while speaking as it might make it hard for others to
understand what you said specially when the audience is from different
countries and aren't used to your accent. speaking slowly also gives
you time to think and filter as there are things which you should not
reveal like company secrets, remember [the formal setting of
programming conversations]?

[the formal setting of programming conversations]: /communication/tone

over time you should develop your own unique speaking style. like
mmeeks lowers down his voice around the end of the sentence or when
mst takes pauses and talks in a plain sad tone about the writer bugs
situation. thorsten raises his voice a little when he has to emphasise
on something, like the hump in a camel case variable name, armin's
classic "whatever, we will see"... this isn't easy, it requires quite
some reading and awareness.
