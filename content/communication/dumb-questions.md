title: no question is a dumb question, just ask

most people who have questions but don't ask are those who are scared
of other's judging them and their 'dumb' question. turns out most
people don't care, they forget about it after a day or week. so one
should not miss the opportunity and ask questions actively.

it doesn't mean "think and shoot", keep it with yourself for a moment
or two and then ask, don't be in a hurry (you can ask later too). read
[programming and questions] to learn more.
