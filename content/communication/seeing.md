title: learn to see things as they are

we read/see/hear what we want to based on our assumptions and
expectations. this leads to missunderstandings and often we are
nowhere close to what's being said (written or happening). the
assumptions affecting our perceptions can be images we have made up in
our heads, expectations which we hold close to us, etc.

when something sounds egregious or obvious, or you think you
understood it in the first attempt, just stop for a moment and read it
again and again, ask the other to repeat it, or clear your eyes and
see it again. and then confirm whether you are biased to preceive that
or is it really there. then you would be in a situation to make an
informed decision.

also sometimes the infomration might be incomplete or tampered with,
so always factor in that possibility and confirm things without
reaching any conclusions.
